### 🐧 Linux Compatibility
*Used to Linux? Feel at home on AIX*

A configuration layer for IBM's GNU tools. Makes the excellent IBM AIX Toolbox packages the default in your interactive shell.

**What IBM provides:** GNU coreutils, grep, sed, awk, find, tar, vim, tmux, jq, and more (via AIX Toolbox)  
**What we add:** Shell configuration, aliases, emulated commands, and `systemctl`/`service` wrappers for AIX SRC

- ✅ Puts IBM's GNU tools first in your interactive PATH
- ✅ `systemctl` and `service` wrappers for familiar service management
- ✅ Emulates missing commands (`watch`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `free`)
- ✅ Safe by design—only interactive shells affected
- ✅ Scripts using `#!/bin/sh` remain untouched

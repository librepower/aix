## Why nano?

**If you know how to type, you know how to use nano.**

nano is the default editor on many Linux distributions for good reason: it's simple, fast, and gets out of your way. Perfect for quick edits, config files, and anyone who doesn't want to learn vi keybindings.

| Feature | vi/vim | nano |

| Learning curve | Steep | None |
| Mode switching | Yes (insert/command) | No |
| Keyboard shortcuts | On-screen | Hidden |
| Save and quit | `:wq` | Ctrl+O, Ctrl+X |

## Installation

### Option 1: dnf (Recommended)

Add the LibrePower repository and install with one command:

```bash
# Add repository (one-time setup)
curl -fsSL https://aix.librepower.org/install.sh | sh

# Install (automatically resolves ncurses dependency)
dnf install nano
```

📦 Repository details: https://aix.librepower.org/

### Option 2: curl (if dnf/yum not available)

```bash
cd /tmp

curl -L -o nano-8.3-3.librepower.aix7.3.ppc.rpm \
  https://github.com/librepower/aix/releases/download/nano-v8.3/nano-8.3-3.librepower.aix7.3.ppc.rpm

# Requires ncurses from AIX Toolbox
rpm -ivh nano-8.3-3.librepower.aix7.3.ppc.rpm
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: Use `-L` flag with curl to follow redirects.

### Option 3: GitHub Releases Page

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/librepower/aix/releases/tag/nano-v8.3)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Edit a file
nano /etc/hosts

# Edit with line numbers
nano -l /path/to/script.sh

# Open multiple files
nano file1.txt file2.txt

# Restricted mode (read-only, no save)
rnano sensitive-file.conf
```

## Syntax Highlighting

**Syntax highlighting is enabled by default** for 40+ file types via `/opt/freeware/etc/nanorc`.

Supported languages include: C, C++, Python, Shell, Perl, Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, JSON, YAML, XML, HTML, CSS, SQL, Makefile, and many more.

### Customizing

To add custom syntax or override defaults, create `~/.nanorc`:

```bash
# Load all default syntax files
include "/opt/freeware/share/nano/*.nanorc"

# Add your customizations
set linenumbers
set mouse
```

## Key Bindings

nano displays shortcuts at the bottom of the screen. Here are the essentials:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+O | Save file (WriteOut) |
| Ctrl+X | Exit nano |
| Ctrl+K | Cut current line |
| Ctrl+U | Paste cut text |
| Ctrl+W | Search |
| Ctrl+\ | Search and replace |
| Ctrl+G | Display help |
| Alt+U | Undo |
| Alt+E | Redo |
| Ctrl+C | Show cursor position |
| Alt+# | Toggle line numbers |

> **Note**: `^` means Ctrl key, `M-` means Alt key

## Configuration

nano is configured via:
- `/opt/freeware/etc/nanorc` - Global defaults (syntax highlighting + autoindent)
- `~/.nanorc` - User overrides

### Default Configuration

```nanorc
include "/opt/freeware/share/nano/*.nanorc"
set autoindent
```

### Common Customizations

Add to `~/.nanorc`:

```nanorc
set linenumbers
set mouse
set tabstospaces
set tabsize 4
```
